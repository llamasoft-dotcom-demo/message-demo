                        Implement a messaging system to replace the random alert boxes that come up. The messaging system
                        should meet the following criteria
                        <ul>
                            <li>Messages should appear near the top of the page</li>
                            <li>Messages should fade out after 3 seconds</li>
                            <li>If a new message appears before the previous message fades out, it should appear below the most recent visible message.</li>
                            <li>Messages should have a close or delete box to dismiss the message before the fade out</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to the above features, implement other updates you think might be helpful. E.g. Add an indicator
                        to let the user know that the messages are running in addition to the text change on the button, update the
                        layout to make the page more readable, etc. Feel free to use
                        any third party libraries you find helpful. jQuery and underscore are already referenced.

                        Applicant's notes: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I'd heard about an API for Web Notifications, so I put it in as an option.
                                 Just 'Cancel' at the dialog if you don't want to try these.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Despite indicating it is compatible with 'web notifications', my install of Chrome
                                on my Mac required a change to enable notifications. The settings can be found here - chrome://flags/#enable-native-notifications
                                . Chrome for Windows seemed to work out of the gate.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The small toolbar at upper right allows control of options for messages.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <button type="button" id="msgButton">Start Messages</button>
