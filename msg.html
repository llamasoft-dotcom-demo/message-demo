                Implement a messaging system to replace the random alert boxes that come up. The messaging system
                should meet the following criteria
                <ul>
                <li>Messages should appear near the top of the page - <b>DONE, top left</b></li>
                <li>Messages should fade out after 3 seconds - <b>DONE</b></li>
                <li>If a new message appears before the previous message fades out, it should appear below the most recent visible message. - <b>DONE, minor change to notify.js in setGlobalPosition changing prepend to append</b></li>
                <li>Messages should have a close or delete box to dismiss the message before the fade out- <b>Implemented custom style, but you also get this for free by clicking anywhere on the message.  Not obvious but also functional.</b></li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                In addition to the above features, implement other updates you think might be helpful. E.g. Add an indicator
                to let the user know that the messages are running in addition to the text change on the button, update the
                layout to make the page more readable, etc. Feel free to use
                any third party libraries you find helpful. jQuery and underscore are already referenced.
