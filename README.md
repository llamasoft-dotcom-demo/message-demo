# message-demo
Sample project for prospects


I used notify.js to create a custome alert box positioned to the top right.

I made the messages fade out after three seconds by applying an autoHideDelay property.

I set animaitons to fade in and out.

I created a close box by calling an addStyle method on notify. This assigned a class and a button to the alert and then I created a click function to trigger the close.

I added a paragraph under the picture to let the user know that messages were constantly running. This was done by using the jQuery element selector and the .after method to apply the message. Ex. line 77.
