#### Updates:
* Met basic criteria
* Adjusted exercise text width, looks a little better
* Added a level to messages to display additional data (eg. red text for error message)
* Templating the messages to allow background color and level information

#### Interesting things about the code:
* Never used underscore templating so decided to try that out. Worked well though appears to clutter the HTML file some

#### Suggestions for improvement:
* Work on visuals, just had pretty basic divs, colors, buttons

#### Above and beyond:
* Visually was pretty standard but I think the javascript code is organized and the use of the underscore templates helped keep some clutter out of the code
