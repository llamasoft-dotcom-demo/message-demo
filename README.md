# message-demo
Implement a messaging system to replace the random alert boxes that come up. The messaging system should meet the following criteria

* Messages should appear near the top of the page
  * Done   
* Messages should fade out after 3 seconds
  *  Done
* If a new message appears before the previous message fades out, it should appear below the most recent visible message.
  * Done
* Messages should have a close or delete box to dismiss the message before the fade out
  * Done
* In addition to the above features, implement other updates you think might be helpful. E.g. Add an indicator to let the user know that the messages are running in addition to the text change on the button, update the layout to make the page more readable, etc.
  * For the most part just cleaned up most of the code to get stuff out of the dom ready function. Put it into the object and cleaned up some of the original code. I added little dots to apppear on the button to represent something was happening.
