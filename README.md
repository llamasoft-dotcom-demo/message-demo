# Message-Demo presented by Sarthak Joshi
Since I am applying for position of .net developer I decided to port this very simple application into .net application.
Features included are as follows

# UI Changes
1. Changed layout and styling of application making it responsive.
2. Added Full-width background to give it a nice touch.

# Functional Changes 
1. Added new view message and add message controls enabling end user to check actual message set and add custom message [Instead of having it in code behind array]
2. Completed requirement to have start message and stop message button which shows messages on top of screen in unobtrusive ways
3. Added spinner icon to give visual feedback when messages are being displayed

# Future Enhancements
1. Messages can be stored in backend using some db framework and server side api can be used to pass data as json to front end
2. Edit/Delete message functionality can be added
3. User can have more control over notifications [Type/Color/Width/Screen placement...]

# Fun Part (Yay!!!!)
1. Added "Random Chuck Norris" notification button
2. The idea behind this is to demonstrate real world api calls using angular HTTP service and reuse existing code [notification factory/message controller] to show message received from API.


# Technologies Used
